# manUp

## [9.2.0]

- Add a new `error` ManUpStatus that can be handled via the `ManUpService` `ChangeNotifier`

## [9.1.0]

- `ManUpService` now implements `ChangeNotifier` and the most recent status can be retrieved from the `status` getter
- `onComplete`, `onError` and `shouldShowAlert` on `ManUpWidget` are now optional (`shouldShowAlert` defaults to `() => true`)
- `ManUpWidget` now exposes an optional `onStatusChanged`
- "Kill switch" (`disabled`) and required update alert dialogs are no longer barrier dismissable.
- Changes to status will now show updated dialogs
- Update examples

## [9.0.1]

- Relax version requirements for firebase

## [9.0.0]

- Support `package_info_plus` up to version 10 (relax version requirements)

## [8.0.0]

- Update `package_info_plus` from v4 to v6

## [7.0.0]

- **Breaking change** Separate service into `HttpManUpService` and `FireBaseRemoteConfigManUpService`

  - Extract `HttpManUpService` from `ManUpService` and create `FireBaseRemoteConfigManUpService` to support fetching app config with HTTP and Firebase remote config
  - Now, the user who use `ManUpService` in previous release

    ```dart
    ManUpService service = ManUpService('https://example.com/manup.json', client: http.Client());
    ```

    will need to change to

    ```dart
    HttpManUpService service = HttpManUpService('https://example.com/manup.json', client: http.Client());
    ```

## [6.0.0]

- **Breaking change** Update version check logic
  - Previously, if the app version was higher than the latest version, the minVersion check was effectively ignored.
  - Now, all version checks are run individually and `latest` is only returned if everything passes.
- Add initial support for web platform
  - Running on web now looks for the `web` key in the `manup.json` file instead of outright failing

## [5.0.1]

- Use less strict http version

## [5.0.0]

- **Breaking change** Update http to `1.x.y` and package_info_plus to `4.x.x`
  - A result of this (due to `package_info_plus` update) is now minimum Android API 19 and iOS version 11
  - See the respective packages for any further breaking changes
